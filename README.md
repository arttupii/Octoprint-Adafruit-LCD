# OctoPrint-Piprint

Displays printer progress while printing on a [Adafruit 16x2 LCD](http://www.adafruit.com/search?q=16x2+pi&b=1) attached 
to a [Rasperry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org). This makes it easy to see print progress without the need to look 
at [OctoPrint](http://www.octoprint.org).

## Setup
You must perform a bit of setup and configuration before using this plugin.

### Requirements before setup
To use this plugin, you must have
[properly configured](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-16x2-character-lcd-plus-keypad-for-raspberry-pi/usage)

**Please note** - If you used a virtual environment for your OctoPrint install, you should configure your LCD for that 
virtual environment.
